### üêã Deploying with Kubernetes

If you‚Äôre familiar with Kubernetes, you can deploy this project too. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Prepare Kubernetes Files**:
   - The repository includes:
     - `deployment.yaml` (to create the application pods).
     - `service.yml` (to expose the app).
     - `namespace.yaml` (for app isolation).

2. **Create a Namespace**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

3. **Deploy the App**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yml
```

4. **Access the App**:
   Use port-forwarding to access the app locally:
```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/portfolio-service -n portfolio 6543:6543
```
   Open [http://localhost:6543](http://localhost:6543) to view your portfolio.
